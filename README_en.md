## What, and why HYC?
 According to the survey conducted by our team, foreign students in Hanyang University have difficulties in adapting school life. 59.5% of students were receiving their school events information through SNS, email, or community sites/apps. However, we've got response that those platforms have low information accesability, and 49% of them have intermediate Korean language skills but having hard time with platforms which is Korean only.\
 Therefore **90.3%** of foreign students agreed that community app for foreign student would be helpful, which means high potential of this app.\
  This app gives you 3 core services :
   - Translation of events written in Korean into each langauge
   - Community Function that has translate options
   - Calendar that shows our school's event at a glance
